## ThoughtWorks Australia Clojure Meet-up

This repository will hold the solutions for the problems and hacking sessions we work on each meetup.

If you've been to one of the meetups and wants to see your solution here, just fork the project and send me a pull request.

### Forking this project

Make sure you follow the current convention (since we're just starting feel free to organize it better and send the pull request with the new proposed structure):

Each meetup lives in a root directory named after that meetup's **ordinal number**, a **dash**, and the meetup **date**, like so:

**1-20111012**

Inside the meetup directory, create a directory with your name, and put your solution there. After doing that, the directory should look similar to this:

*  1-20111012/  
   *  problem-statement.txt  
   *  leo-kumar/  
      * 1.clj 

Don't forget to create the problem statement file if there isn't one already.

An lastly, have fun! :)
