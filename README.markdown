## ThoughtWorks Australia Clojure Meet-up

This repository will hold the solutions for the problems and hacking sessions we work on each meetup.

If you've been to one of the meetups and wants to see your solution here, just fork the project and send me a pull request.

### Forking this project

Make sure you follow the current convention (since we're just starting feel free to organize it better and send the pull request with the new proposed structure):

Each meetup lives in a root directory named after that meetup's **ordinal number**, a **dash**, and the meetup **date**, like so:

**1-20111012**

Inside the meetup directory, create a directory with your name, and put your solution there. If you're the person creating the meetup root directory, don't forget to add a text file with the problem statement inside it. Just use the first meetup directory, already created, as a starting point.

An lastly, have fun! :)
